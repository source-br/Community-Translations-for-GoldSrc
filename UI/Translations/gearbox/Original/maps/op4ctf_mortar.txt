Mortar

As part of the initial assault,
the military carefully placed
mounted guns with crossing fields
of fire to support the invading
troops. In the confusion of battle,
Black Mesa civilians managed to
capture a powerful mortar cannon.
The soldiers quickly responded to
the counterassault but not before
the civilians had gained complete
control of one of the soldier's
fortifications.  Now, the civilians
and soldiers must decide between
controlling sniper points or the
mounted guns in order to win the
battle.
