Black Mesa Biodomes

The Black Mesa laboratories included
an experimental biodome, which simulated
the environments of the border world of
Xen. The biodome, separated into
quadrants, was designed to allow
scientists many angles to watch and
interact with experiments. Therefore,
the design of the biodome allowed for
vantage points from high, low and middle
ground - making the dome a strategically
important landmark. When the soldiers
invaded and captured one quadrant of the
biodomes (turning it into a makeshift HQ),
a battle ensued between the military and
the civilians each fighting for control
of the domes.
