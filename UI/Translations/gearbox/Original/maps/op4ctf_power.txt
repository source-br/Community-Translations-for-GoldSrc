Power Struggle 

In an attempt to rendezvous with Dr. 
Rosenberg and facilitate his plan for 
escape, a group of BMRF personnel 
entered an abandoned facility that 
once supplied coolant to the main 
power generators for the labs nearby. 
As the group entered the areas below 
the Displacement Field Labs, they 
were intercepted by a military squad 
assigned to eliminate any remaining 
civilians.  A fierce battle ensued.
