Hydro-Electric Dam

Small security stations were set up
in the immediate areas surrounding
the hydroelectric dams that supplied
much of Black Mesa's power demands.
When a group of escaping civilians
comandeered one of these locations,
a squad of soldiers was sent in to
clear them out and restore the power
flow, and a battle quickly ensued.
