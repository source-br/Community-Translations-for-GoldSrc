The Wonderland

About once every 75 years, the
temperature in the peaks over
the Black Mesa facility drops
to below freezing.  The older
bunkers there become blanketed
with snow and the river becomes
covered in ice.  For the first
time, the pure, white terrain
was scarred with the colors of
battle as military death squads
captured one of the abandoned
bunkers in order to stage an
assault on the Black Mesa
personnel defending another
bunker nearby.
