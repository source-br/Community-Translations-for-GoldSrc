Gun Yard

Since Black Mesa Research Facility
was built upon a retired nuclear
missile center, there are many long
abandoned storehouses and weapons
caches scattered around the area.
The civilians, fighting for survival,
planned to sneak through the gunyard
into one of the storage areas in
hopes of arming themselves.  However,
the soldiers had anticipated this
move and stationed a platoon at one
side of the gunyard.  The civilian
force was strong and quick enough to
enter the storehouse and gather the
weapons, but the battle has yet to be
won.
